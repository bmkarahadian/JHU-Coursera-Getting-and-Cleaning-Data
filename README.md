# JHU-Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
This repository contains the final assignment for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

* The txt files that begin with "UCI_HAR" contain the metadata from the original dataset.
* "run_analysis.R" contains all the code that tidies the original dataset into a more workable format and reduces the available statistics to only the means and standard deviatons generated. It concludes by creating "final.txt" which contains the average mean and average standard deviation for each variable grouped by subject and activity.
* "Codebook.md" is an addendum to the original UCI HAR metadata that explains the variables and the transformations that generated the variables in the tidy dataset.
